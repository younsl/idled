## Command Usage

You can use the `--list-services` (or `-l`) flag to list all supported services.

```bash
idled --list-services
```

You can specify which services to scan using the `--services` (or `-s`) flag, providing a comma-separated list (e.g., `-s ec2,ebs,s3`). If no services are specified, `idled` will scan the default service (`ec2`).

```bash
idled -s ec2,ebs,s3
```
