Amazon S3 is a widely used object storage service. However, buckets can be forgotten or become unused over time. These buckets still incur costs based on the amount of data stored and the number of requests. Buckets with very low access frequency are potential sources of wasted cost.

## Scan Criteria

- `idled` identifies S3 buckets as **idle** if they meet the following criteria:
    - **No Recent Access:** No data access requests (like `GetObject`, `PutObject`) recorded in CloudTrail for a certain period (default: 90 days).
    - **Very Small Size:** The total size of the bucket is very small (e.g., 0 bytes). (Requires CloudWatch Storage Metrics)
- *Note:* The current S3 scan logic in `idled` primarily checks CloudTrail access. CloudWatch Storage Metrics integration might be added later. The exact definition of an idle bucket can vary based on organizational policies.

### Command

```bash
idled -s s3 -r <REGION>
```

## Cost Model

- S3 costs depend on several factors: data stored (per storage class), number of requests (GET, PUT, etc.), and data transfer.
- `idled` focuses on identifying potentially idle buckets rather than calculating exact costs. Removing these buckets can lead to cost savings. The current version does not estimate potential savings due to the complexity of S3 pricing.
